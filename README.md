Using python for spatial data analysis  and machine learning to predict the daily number of vaccines to be administered.   
## Project description
The process involved include:
- Data analysis using pandas and geopandas lin.
- Data visualisation using geopandas, folium, natplotlib and seaborn.
- Predictive analysis using statsmodels and scikit-learn.
#### Machine learning models used include:
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- XGBoost
